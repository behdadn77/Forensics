Discussion and conclusions

SSD Tehnology

• NAND-based flash memory chips used as mass storage
• Increasingly popular as prices drop
• Widespread use in mobile devices
• On the surface, a snap-in replacement for rotational drives

(HDD)

Comprehensive Black-box Methodology for Testing the Forensic Characteristics of SSDs

Introduction

Our testing methodology

Putting it together: forensic friendliness

Discussion and conclusions

Under the surface...

• SSDs have a shorter lifespan as cells have a physical limit of

approx. 10,000 program-erase cycles
• Rewrite = blanking of a complete block (16 to 512kB)
• Led to development of flash translation layer (FTL) [5, 7],

hw/sw combination that sits between ATA channel and
memory chips

Discussion and conclusions

FTL magic

• Write caching
• Trimming
• Garbage collection
• Data compression
• Data encryption/obfuscation
• Bad block handling
• Wear leveling

Introduction

Our testing methodology

Putting it together: forensic friendliness

Discussion and conclusions

In other words...

• In HDDs we can reliably phisically address a sector from the

OS and read it on the drive
• In SDDs FTL translates logical block addresses (LBA) as

requested by the OS into the respective physical block
addresses (PBA) on memory chips. The underlying mapping is
completely transparent and can be modified by the FTL at any
time for any reason. The FTL may move data around or blank
data even if the OS is not running
• Yay. Most forensic approaches and tools rely on the ability of

the OS to access the raw data on the disk

Stefano Zanero

Introduction

Our testing methodology

Putting it together: forensic friendliness

Discussion and conclusions

Can we bypass the FTL?
• Not via software.
• In theory, can be bypassed by reading directly the memory

chips [3] (via flashing tools, JTAG port, or physical extraction
of chips)
• [4, 8] built a complete custom setup to interact with flash
memory chips using an FPGA and custom wing boards. Their
goal is prototyping but similar setup could be used to
reimplement FTL logic and read memory chips
• In any case:
• extremely time and money consuming process (needs custom

hardware, reverse engineer FTL implementation...)
• non-repeatable, leads to alterattion or destruction of the

evidence
• very brittle process depending on firmware, hardware...
• information not public and actually heavily protected IP of

vendors

Comprehensive Black-box Methodology for Testing the Forensic Characteristics of SSDs

Introduction

Our testing methodology

Putting it together: forensic friendliness

Discussion and conclusions

An unclear picture

• Previous work suggests impact on black box forensic analysis.
• [2] analyzes file recovery rate (SSDs vs HDDs)
• Observes that even a write blocker does not prevent the FTL
from modifying and in some cases blanking the evidence
• Suggests a filesystem aware garbage collection feature in FTLs
• [6] tested 16 SSDs with usage scenarios and concluded that

different combinations of usage, OS and file size influence
recoverability (most sensible and extensive paper to date)
• [1] found that carving didn’t work at all on SSDs
• Other (non-scientific) reports suggested that data duplication

due to wear leveling would increase recoverability

Our testing methodology

Discussion and conclusions

The need for a triage methodoloy

• We developed a simple and affordable black-box triage

procedure to:
1
2

assess impacts of FTL on the use of black-box tools
assess likelihood of success of a white-box attempt

• Test driven workflow of experiments to assess the behavior of

the FTL under different conditions
• We can determine whether a SSD implements trimming,

garbage collection, compression and/or wear leveling

Comprehensive Black-box Methodology for Testing the Forensic Characteristics of SSDs

Introduction

Our testing methodology

Putting it together: forensic friendliness

Discussion and conclusions

What we test for (1)
TRIM: preemptive blanking of erased blocks marked for
trimming by the OS. Negative impact on forensics as
data persistence is reduced. [2] notes that this can
occur even with a write blocker, impacting
acquisition. Our methodology can determine the
percentage of blocks that get erased and how fast
Garbage collection: hypothesized by [2] to work with a
filesystem-aware controller, that TRIMs block without
OS support. Forensic impact obvious. We can
determine whether it is employed by the SSD under
examination
Erasing patterns: peculiar behaviors shown by some SSDs when
using TRIM
Stefano Zanero

Introduction

Our testing methodology

Putting it together: forensic friendliness

Discussion and conclusions

What we test for (2)

Compression: transparently employed by some drives to use less
physical blocks and reduce wear. No challenges in
black box analysis, but definite challenge in white
box. We can verify whether compression is active
Wear leveling: spreads consumption of cells as evenly as possible
across the drive. We test for the so-called “write
amplification” effect, which is a direct consequence of
the wear leveling
Files recoverability: a test on the efficacy of black box file recovery
techniques

Introduction

Our testing methodology

Putting it together: forensic friendliness

Discussion and conclusions

A small but important caveat

• SSDs are equipped with a small amount of DRAM-based

cache memory to reduce physical writes
• This can bias any test using small files (i.e. smaller than

512MB-1GB, typical cache size)
• Experiments in [1] were probably biased by this, and files were

never written to disk, explaining zero carving results. Ditto for
[6]
• Solution is simply to disable cache (e.g. on Linux via hdparm

-W 0) or to use large files.

Discussion and conclusions

Results

• [2] found out that GC triggers in almost 3 minutes.
• non-authoritative sources state 3 to 12 hours
• In our test, none of the SSDs performed garbage collection.

We even tried to replicate the exact test of [2], with identical
hardware, software and firmware version, but to no avail, even
with the assistance of the author.

Figure : Mean and variance of the sampled throughput among 15
repeated transfers of 10GB low (top) and high (bottom) entropy files.
Intuition is that overhead for hw compression negligible, thus takes less
to write files that can be compressed. Samsung and Crucial drives show
no difference: no compression; Corsair performs hw compression instead.

Table : Files recoverability test results: the drives implementing an
aggressive version of TRIM (Samsung S470 on NTFS and Crucial M4),
did not allow the recovery of any file after a format procedure. The
Corsair F60 on NTFS, as expected, has a non-null recovery rate due to
the erasing pattern its TRIM implementation exposes. On ext4, however,
this same disk allowed the recovery of 0 out of 99,475 files.

Our testing methodology

Discussion and conclusions

Limitations

• We did not test multiple firmware versions, as firmware

upgrades are one-way in most cases and this would make the
experiments difficult to repeat
• We did not test on difference of device driver and AHCI

commands, for simplicity
• If investigator does not know OS version in use, our

methodology may not give usable insights

Conclusions

• SSDs implement techniques that are potentially disruptive to

black box forensics
• We created a triage workflow to understand impact and

potential gain of white-box approach
• We showed that the combination of controller, OS, filesystem

and even disk usage can deeply influence forensic procedures
• We showed that garbage collection is not currently offered by

leading drives on the market
