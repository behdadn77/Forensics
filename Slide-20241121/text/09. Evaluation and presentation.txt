8. Evaluation and
Presentation
Digital Forensics and Cybercrime course
Prof. Zanero

The evaluation phase
● Need to match the evidence elements
(~facts) with the required legal elements to
support (or negate) a legal theory
● E.g. the law punishes “willingly detaining
child pornography”?
○ Child pornography: we can scan drives for images,
and then have (if needed) a doctor attest to the age
of subjects
○ Willingly detaining: we can use elements like access
dates, conservation in folders, sorting...
2

Items to evaluate
● The elements to support the indictment
● Alternative explanations to the elements
● Analyzing what can be said, what cannot,
and what further experiments would be
needed to say more
○ The latter is important to analyze whether these
experiments will be performed by the counterpart,
and whether performing them or asking for them to
be performed entails risk

3

Relationship with lawyers
● Lawyers own the choice of defense strategy
○ They may ask for the expert’s counsel
○ But the expert must yield to them

● Lawyers own the relationship with the client
○ Experts should never tarnish this relationship
○ If you are unable to do this, you need to resign

● Lawyers (and customer) pay your bill, but do
not dictate what you write or say
○ You should always write and say only that of which
you are personally convinced
○ You may be asked to omit a finding, as long as this
omission is not the same as lying.

Relationship with the customer
● The expert assists one of the parts in the
judgment
○ Mandate: finding what helps the customer

● This is not the same as “helping someone
escape law”: this is part of the due process
of applying law
● “Process truth” is not the same as historical
truth

5

Relationship with prosecutors/police
● Assisting the prosecutors or the police does
not entail moral superiority
● Still very important to stick to science and
facts
● Important not to get your words or thoughts
shaped by “justice”

6

Evaluation: analyzing the documents
● A key component of the evaluation process
is reviewing documents and evidence
already presented in the proceedings
○ In particular, written reports of other expert
witnesses and investigators

● What to look for:
○
○
○
○

Technical/factual errors (or omissions)
Unclear reasoning, methodologies or descriptions
Suggestive writing
Opinions and hypotheses not clearly distinct from
facts and not substantiated
7

Typical technical and factual errors
● Acquisition
○ Search and seizure: process, chain of custody,
seals,
○ Description of seized/analyzed materials: serial
numbers, etc
○ Hashing/cloning procedure (e.g. use of write
blockers)

● Analysis
○
○
○
○

Steps where hashing was not verified
Proprietary programs; bugs and vulnerabilities
Description of the process
Technical mistakes (of course!)
8

Typical presentation errors
● No exploration of alternative hypotheses
○ What else could explain the facts? What’s the best
alternative theory?
○ Cliché: trojan defense

● Is the presentation neutral or biased?
● Can we find counter-examples for some of
the assumptions?
● Are there missing explanations that we can
provide in order to shift the understanding of
the judge?
9

Presentation: writing your report
● First and foremost be clear
○ Focused on the items you want to explain, concise
○ If in national language: do not exceed in english
terminology
○ All technical terminology must be explained, if
necessary in a footnote
○ You need to be simple without being simplistic and
without giving the reader the (right) impression that
you are simplifying things for them

● You must explain why what you are saying
is relevant to the reader (i.e. the judge). It is
not obvious to them!

10

How not to write a report
● Don’t be apodictic: “This does not work”. Why doesn’t it?
Maybe it’s obvious to you but not to the reader
● Don’t suggest, don’t use innuendo
● Don’t be too technical, you will not sound more expert,
you will be ignored
● Don’t show bias or solidarity with your client, with the
aggrieved party or the victim, you are a scientist and must
be cold and factual
● Don’t show excessive deference to the judge
● No sarcasm (but if you are very sure of yourself and you
want to aim low, you can use a little bit of irony)
● Don’t use weak arguments if you have more solid ones
11

Structure of a report
● Model it on a scientific paper or report
○ Introduction - tell them what you are going to say
○ Facts
○ Discussion and analysis - each block with a small
introduction saying what you want to explain and a
conclusion summarizing what you just describe
○ Final conclusions where you leave out any doubtful
statement: just distilled, iron truth

● Structure it like an obstacle course, each
obstacle a little taller than the previous one
○ Make the judge sweat to ignore all of your obstacles
12

Structure of a report (example)
1. Foreword
○ I have examined these documents and these
evidence sources
○ I was asked to report on X

2. Introduction
○ In this report, we are going to show A, B, C, D, and
these are all related to the question X because…

3. Acquisition issues
○ Preliminarily, we want to observe the following on
acquisition…
○ Hashes were not computed, and therefore this, this
and this could have happened (don’t stop at
“computed.” and don’t count on chain of custody)
13

Structure of a report (example)
4. On the technical analysis
○ Even ignoring all of our fundamental issues with the
evidence integrity…
○ The connection was not from A to B, but rather to C,
this changes the reconstruction like this, and also
makes these paragraphs of the adversarial report
wrong (don’t stop at “C.”)
○ Even ignoring these factual errors, the evidence is
not best explained as the adversary did, but rather is
much more compatible with these other explanations
○ The following experiment has not been performed,
or the following evidence is missing, and it could...

5. Conclusions
○ (the only thing most judges will consider)
○ In this report we have shown
■ Evidence was not properly acquired and thus
these manipulations may have contaminated
it
■ Item I did not happen as described, making
conclusion C completely wrong (don’t fix it for
them)
■ Theory T fits the facts better
■ Nobody checked if F was true or false, which
could have led to G
○ We must therefore conclude that … (one strong,
inevitable phrase)
15

Testimony as a witness
● In many jurisdictions the expert may just
submit a report, but may be called as
witness
● In others, like in Italy, they must be called as
a witness and then can submit their report
● In most jurisdictions, the expert witness
provides a sworn testimony and can
commit perjury
● This means that, depending on jurisdiction,
an expert witness cannot lie or claim
confidentiality or professional secrecy
16

Direct examination
● Usually you are called by your side and thus
proceed to friendly direct examination
○

○
○

Prepare: have a script with your side’s lawyer
Be clear and very helpful
Make sure you explain everything to the judge
Take your time (but don’t overdo it)
In some jurisdictions (including Italy) judge can ask
questions of their own: prepare; check previous
records of the judge

● Relax and don’t be nervous, because you
now need to stand cross-examination
17

Cross examination
● Examination by the counterpart is less
friendly, sometimes downright hostile
○ Prepare: check previous records of the lawyer,
prosecutor or judge
○ Use your report as a shield and as a way to get time
and think about the answer
○ Be curt if you can: “yes” “no”
○ If you cannot, be very complex and difficult to
understand
○ If unexpectedly a question is positive, immediately
go back to being extremely clear and helpful
○ Don’t get angry
○ Don’t be surprised if your competency is called into
question
