Security Incident
“Any action that threatens one or more of the
classic security services of confidentiality,
integrity, availability, accountability, authenticity,
and reliability in a system.”

Incident Response
Development of procedures to handle and
respond to computer incidents
● Need to reflect the range of possible
consequences of an incident on the
organization.
● Allow for a suitable response.

3

Incident Response Capability
Benefits
● Responding to incidents systematically so
that the appropriate steps are taken.
● Helping personnel to recover quickly and
efficiently minimizing loss or theft of
information and disruption of services.
● Dealing properly with legal issues.
● Using information gained during incident
handling
○ to better prepare for handling future incidents
○ to provide stronger protection for systems and data

Use Case:
Mass Email Worm Infection
Exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in desktop
applications and then spread via e-mail.
The volume of traffic these can generate could
be high enough to cripple both intranet and
Internet Connections.
Obvious response:
● Disconnect the organization from the
Internet
● Shut down the internal email system

6

Use Case:
Mass Email Worm Infection
● Serious impact the organization’s processes
Need to find a trade-off between major loss
of functionality against further significant
systems compromise.

7

Use Case:
Mass Email Worm Infection
● Serious impact the organization’s processes
Need to find a trade-off
A good incident response policy should:
● Indicate the action to take for an incident of
this severity.
● Specify the personnel who have the
responsibility to make decisions and detail
how they can be quickly contacted.
8

Managing Security Incidents
Procedures and controls that address:
● Detecting potential security incidents.
● Sorting,
categorizing,
and
prioritizing
incoming incident reports.
● Identifying and responding to breaches in
security.
● Documenting breaches in security for future
reference.

9

Security Incident Terminology
● Artifact
○ Any file or object found on a system that might be
involved in probing or attacking systems and
networks or that is being used to defeat security
measures.

● Computer Security Incident Response
Team (CSIRT)
○ A capability set up for the purpose of assisting in
responding to computer security–related Incidents
that involve sites within a defined constituency, also
called CERT, or with other acronyms
10

Computer Security Incident
Response Team (CSIRT)
Responsible for:
1. Rapidly detecting incidents.
2. Minimizing loss and destruction.
3. Mitigating the weaknesses that were
exploited.
4. Restoring computing services.

11

Security Incident Terminology
● Constituency
○ The group of users, sites, networks, or organizations
served by the CSIRT.

● Incident
○ A violation or imminent threat of violation of
computer security policies.

● Triage
○ The process of receiving, sorting, and prioritizing of
information to facilitate its appropriate handling.

● Vulnerability
12

Detecting Incident
Security incidents may be detected by:
● Users who report a system malfunction or
anomalous behavior or weaknesses of the
system.
○ Staff should be encouraged to make such reports
(training).

● Automated tools that analyze information
gathered from the systems and connecting
networks.
13

Automated tools for Incident
Detection Categories
● System integrity verification tools:
○

Scan critical system files, directories, and services to ensure they
have not been changed without proper authorization.

● Log analysis tools:
○

Analyze the information collected in audit logs using form of pattern
recognition to identify potential security incidents.

● Network and host intrusion detection
systems (IDS):
○

Monitor and analyze network and host activity and usually compare
this information with a collection of attack signatures to identify
potential security incidents.

● Intrusion prevention systems (IPS):
○

Augment an intrusion detection system with the ability to automatically
block detected attacks.

15

Automated Tools for Incident
Detection
● The effectiveness depends on:
○ the accuracy of their configuration;
○ the correctness of the patterns and signatures used.

● They need to:
○ Be updated regularly.
○ Distinguish adequately between normal, legitimate
behavior and anomalous attack behavior.

16

Automated Tools for Incident
Detection key advantages
It is difficult for security administrators to keep
pace with the rapid changes to the security
risks to their systems and to respond in a timely
manner.
● Can track changes in known attacks
● Help reduce the risks to the organization
from delayed response

17

Automated Tools for Incident
Deployment
Their deploy involves significant resources,
both monetary and personnel time
● needs to be justified by the benefits gained
in reducing risks.
The decision to deploy automated tools
depends on:
● The organization’s security goals and
objectives.
● The specific needs identified in the risk
assessment process.

18

Triage Function

GOAL: Ensure that all information destined for
the incident handling service is channeled
through a single focal point regardless of the
method by which it arrives for appropriate
redistribution and handling within the service.

19

Triage Function
The triage function responds to incoming
information:
1. It may need to request additional information in order to
categorize the incident.
2. If the incident relates to a known vulnerability,
a. it notifies the enterprise about it.
b. shares information about how to fix or mitigate it.
3. It identifies the incident as either new or part of an
ongoing incident and passes this information on to the
incident handling response function in priority order.

20

Responding to Incidents
Once a potential incident is detected, there must be
documented procedures to respond to it.
Response activities:
● Taking action to protect systems and networks affected
or threatened by intruder activity.
● Providing solutions and mitigation strategies from
relevant alerts.
● Looking for intruder activity on other parts of the
network.
● Filtering network traffic.
● Rebuilding systems.
● Patching or repairing systems.
● Developing other response or workaround strategies.

21

Response Procedures
Response procedure must:
● Identify
○ The cause of the security incident
(accidental/deliberate)
○ Typical categories of such incidents
○ The approach taken to respond to them
○ The management personnel responsible for making
critical decisions and how to contact them.
○ The circumstances when security breaches should
be reported to third parties.
● Describe the action taken to recover from the incident
○ minimizing the compromise or harm to the
organization
● Gather the evidence of the incident.

22

Gathering Evidence
This information is used to
1. help recover from the incident
2. If the incident is reported to the police, then
this evidence may also be needed for legal
proceedings.

23

Responding to Incidents
A number of issues should be considered:
● How critical the system is to the
organization’s function.
● The current and potential technical effect of
the incident in terms of how significantly the
system has been compromised.

24

Incident Handling Life Cycle

25

The cyclic process of IT security
management
● Identify what vulnerability led to its
occurrence and how this might be addressed
to prevent the incident in the future.
● Details of the incident and the response
taken are recorded for future reference.
● The impact on the organization’s systems
and their risk profile must also be
reconsidered as a result of the incident
○ A security incident reflects
■ a change in the risk profile of the organization
■ reviewing the risk assessment and controls
