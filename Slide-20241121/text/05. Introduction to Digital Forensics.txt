What does “Digital Forensics”
mean?
● Forensics is the application of scientific
analysis methods to reconstruct evidence.
● Digital (or Computer) Forensics is the
application of scientific analysis methods to
digital data, computer systems, and network
data to reconstruct evidence.

The “Daubert” standard (US)
RULE 702. TESTIMONY BY EXPERT WITNESSES
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,
skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the
form of an opinion or otherwise if:
(a) The expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized
knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the
evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
(b) The testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
(c) The testimony is the product of reliable principles
and methods; and
(d) The expert has reliably applied the principles and
methods to the facts of the case.

Elements of the Daubert standard
● Relevance and reliability: expert testimony
"relevant to the task at hand" and rests "on a
reliable foundation"
● Scientific knowledge = scientific
method/methodology
What is the “scientific method”?

What does “scientific” mean?
● Scientific = Repeatable (Galileo, 1650)

● Scientific = Falsifiable (Popper, 1934)
“In so far as a scientiﬁc statement speaks about reality, it must be
falsiﬁable: and in so far as it is not falsiﬁable, it does not speak about
reality.”
― Karl R. Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery

Daubert test for “scientific”
● Factors to consider:
○ Whether the theory or technique employed by the
expert is generally accepted in the scientific
community
○ Whether it has been subjected to peer review and
publication
○ Whether it can be and has been tested
○ Whether the known or potential rate of error is
acceptable; and
○ Whether the research was conducted independent
of the particular litigation or dependent on an
intention to provide the proposed testimony.
