“Fraud is an uncommon, well-considered, imperceptibly
concealed, time-evolving and often carefully organized
crime which appears in many types of forms.”
Van Vlasselaer et al.

Fraud is a social phenomenon

Fraud Characteristics
... uncommon ...
Only a minority of cases concerns fraud, of which only a
limited number will be known to concern fraud.
This makes it difficult to
● Detect fraud: fraudulent cases are covered by the
legitimate ones
● Learn from historical cases, since only few examples
are available
10

Fraud Characteristics
...well-considered and imperceptibly
concealed ...
Fraudsters try to remain unnoticed and covered.
● blend in frauds
● not behave different from non-fraudsters
Fraudsters hide very well by well-considering and
planning how to precisely commit fraud.
● Frauds are not impulsive and unplanned.

Why do People Commit Fraud?
Basic driver for commiting fraud = potential monetary
gain or benefit.

Frauds Categories
● Banking and Credit card fraud
● Insurance fraud
● Corruption
● Counterfeit
● Product warranty fraud
● Healthcare fraud
● Telecommunications fraud
● Money laundering

● Tax evasion
● Plagiarism

18

Frauds Categories:
Banking and Credit Card Fraud
Unauthorized taking of another’s credit

1. Application fraud: obtaining new credit cards from
issuing companies by using false PII, and then spending
as much as possible in a short space of time.
2. Behavioral fraud: details of legitimate cards are
obtained fraudulently. It does not necessarily require
stealing the physical card, but only credentials.
19

Frauds Categories:
Insurance Fraud
Fraud related to any type of insurance
● From the side of the seller of an insurance contract
○ selling policies from nonexistent companies;
○ churning policies to create more commissions.

● From the side of the buyer of an insurance contract
○ exaggerated claims (property)
○ falsified medical history (health)
○ postdated policies, faked death, kidnapping or murder
(life)
○ faked damage (automobile )
20

Frauds Categories:
Corruption
The misuse of entrusted power for private gain.
Many Subtypes of corruption

21

Frauds Categories:
Counterfeit
An imitation intended to be passed off deceptively as
genuine
Counterfeit typically concerns valuable objects
● credit cards,
● identity cards,
● popular products,
● money,
● ...

22

Frauds Categories:
Product warranty fraud
Product warranty = Type of guarantee that a manufacturer
makes regarding the condition of its product.
● Terms in which repairs or exchanges will be made in the
event that the product does not function as originally
described or intended.
Fraudulently claiming compensation or remuneration
based on a product warranty.

23

Frauds Categories:
Healthcare fraud
Filing of dishonest healthcare claims to make profit.

24

Frauds Categories:
Telecommunications fraud
Theft or use of telecommunication services to commit
other forms of fraud
Cloning fraud = the cloning of a phone number and the
related call credit by a fraudster.
Superimposition fraud = fraudulent usage is added to the
legitimate usage of an account.

25

Frauds Categories:
Money laundering
Taking the proceeds of criminal activity and making them
appear legal
● Allows criminals to transform illegally obtained gain
into seemingly legitimate funds.
It is a worldwide problem, with an estimated $300 billion
gain in the United States.

26

Frauds Categories:
Click fraud
Illegal clicks on a website’s click-through
advertisements to increase the payable number of
clicks to the advertiser.
The illegal clicks could either be performed by
● manually
● automated

27

Frauds Categories:
Identity theft
Obtaining the personal or financial information of another
person for the purpose of assuming that person’s identity
to make transactions or purchases.
● Sift through trash bins looking for bank account and
credit card statements.
● Accessing databases to steal lists of customer
information.

28

Frauds Categories:
Tax evasion
Illegal act or practice of failing to pay taxes that are
owed.
Example
Knowingly not reporting or underreporting income

29

Frauds Categories:
Plagiarism
Steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as own
● to use another’s production without crediting the source,
● to commit literary theft,
● to present as new and original an idea or product
derived from an existing source.
It involves both stealing someone else’s work and lying
about it afterward.

30

Possible Fraud Vector:
Social Engineering
“Social engineering uses influence and persuasion to deceive
people by convincing them that the social engineer is someone he
is not, or by manipulation. As a result, the social engineer is able to
take advantage of people to obtain information with or without the
use of technology”
-KEVIN D. MITNICK & William L. Simon - Art of Deception

“The art, or better yet, science, of skilfully manoeuvring human
beings to take action in some aspect of their lives”
– Christopher Hadnagy
31

What is Social Engineering?
“The act of manipulating a person to take an action that
may or may not be in the target’s best interest. This may
include obtaining information, gaining access, or getting the
target to take certain action.”
Attacker uses human interaction to obtain or compromise
information by psychologically manipulating a person into
knowingly or unknowingly giving up this information.
Essentially 'hacking' into a person to steal valuable
information from many sources.
32

Why Social Engineering ?
It consistently works, while technology vulnerabilities are
hardened and solved

“You could spend a fortune purchasing technology and
services from every exhibitor, speaker and sponsor at the
RSA Conference, and your network infrastructure could still
remain vulnerable to old-fashioned manipulation.”
Kevin Mitnick

33

Why Social Engineering ?
Path of Least Resistance
○ Why spend hours, days, weeks to crack a password
when you can just ask for it?

34

Why Social Engineering ?
People are the largest vulnerability in any security chain!

● No technology in the world can prevent social
engineering!
○ There is no patch for human stupidity!
35

Fraud Prevention: What is Strong
Customer Authentication?
● A new European regulatory requirement
○
○

reduce fraud
make online payments more secure.

● To accept payments and meet SCA requirements:
○

build additional authentication into your checkout flow.

● SCA requires authentication to use at least two of the
following three elements:

Fraud Prevention: Example Classic
Technologies
One-time password generators:
● Private key + counter synchronized with the host.
● Client: password = Encrypt(counter, private key).
● Host: counter = Decrypt(password, public key).
● Check that the counter is the expected one.
● The counter changes every 30–60 seconds.
Application examples: online banking, admin console
(e.g., Amazon AWS).
Smart cards (or USB keys)
● CPU + non-volatile RAM with a private key.
● The smart card authenticates itself to host via a
challenge-response protocol.
● Uses the private key to encrypt the challenge.
● The private key does not leave the device.
● Should be tamper proof to some extent.
Application examples: credit cards (+PIN).

66

Static OTP lists (cheaper alternative)

●
●
●
●

Known to both client and host.
Host chooses a challenge: random numbers (e.g., "second digit of the 14th cell").
The client transmits the response (hopefully, over an encrypted channel).
The host should not keep the list in clear (e.g., hashing).

67

Expert-based Knowledge

Expert-based approach
Based on the Domain knowledge of the fraud analyst
● Gathering and processing the right information in the
right manner.
Detailed and manual investigation of suspicious cases,
which may indicate a new fraud mechanism
● understand and address the new mechanism.
Comprehension of the fraud mechanism allows
extending the fraud detection and prevention mechanism.
74

Fraud Investigation and
Management
When fraudulent activities have been detected and
confirmed two types of measures are typically taken:
1. Corrective measures
2. Preventive measures

75

Corrective measures
Aim to resolve the fraud and correct the consequences.

Retrospective screening: Actions to retrospectively
detect and subsequently address similar fraud cases

The sooner corrective measures are taken and fraud is
detected, the more effective such measures are and the
more losses can be avoided.
76

Preventive measures
Actions that aim at preventing future frauds, making the
organization more robust and less vulnerable.

Typical process
1. Investigate the fraud case to understand the underlying
mechanisms.
2. Extend the available expert knowledge with the
discovered mechanisms.
3. Adjust the detection and prevention system.
77

Expert-based approach:
Rule-based engine
If-Then rules
● Describe previously detected fraud patterns
● Applied to future transactions
○ trigger an alert when a fraud may be committed.

78

Red Flags of Frauds
“Red flags is the anomaly, deviation from normality that is, a
variation from predictable patterns of behavior or, simply,
something that seems out of place. “
Grabosky and Duffield

Red-flags are translated in expert rules and included in a
rule engine

90

Data-Driven Fraud Detection

1. Precision
2. Operational efficiency
3. Cost efficiency
4. Growing amount of interest

91

Precision
Organizations have a limited investigation capacity
Increased detection power w.r.t to classic approaches.
● Process massive volumes of information to uncover
frauds that are not apparent to the human eye.
Goals of a fraud-detection system
● Make optimal use of the limited investigation capacity
● Maximize the fraction of fraudulent cases among the
inspected ones (more frauds detected).
Higher Precision -> Higher fraction of inspected frauds

92

Operational and Cost Efficiency
● Increasing amount of cases to be analyzed, requires
automated processes.
● Operational requirements exist, imposing time
constraints on the processing of a case.
Example: Credit Card vs Bank Transfer
Expert-based fraud-detection system is challenging and
labor intensive
Automated data-driven approaches are compliant with
stringent operational requirements

93

Growing amount of interest
The negative social and financial impact of frauds
Increase awareness and attention for fraud
Growing investments and research from academia,
industry, and government

Fraud-Detection Techniques
Fraudsters develop advanced strategies to cover/blend in
their tracks to avoid being detected (camouflage / mimicry /
adversarial ML)
Need for new techniques that are able to detect and
address stealthy patterns

1. Unsupervised learning or descriptive analytics
techniques
2. Supervised learning or predictive analytics techniques
102

Unsupervised learning techniques
or descriptive analytics
Unsupervised
● They do not require labeled observations
● Learn the norm from historical observation
Detecting anomalies = Find behavior that deviates from
normal one
Allow detecting novel fraud pattern
● Different in nature from historical fraud
● Make use of new, unknown mechanisms

106

Unsupervised learning techniques

Prone to deception: camouflage-like fraud strategies.
Detect a new fraud if it leads to detectable deviations from
normality
Need to be improved by complementing other tools.

107

Supervised learning techniques or
predictive analytics
Learn from historical observations to retrieve patterns that
allow differentiating normal and fraudulent behavior.
Aim at finding tracks that fraudsters cannot hide: “known
alarms”
Can be applied to
● Predict fraud
● Detect fraud
● Estimate the amount of fraud.
108

Supervised learning techniques
limitations

109

Supervised learning techniques
limitations

They need historical examples to learn from (i.e., a
labeled data set of historically observed fraud behavior).
Low detection power against different and new fraud
types (i.e., not detected so far and not included in the
historical database of fraud) -> detected by descriptive
analytics

110

Complementarity of supervised and
unsupervised methods
Use of both methods in developing a powerful
fraud-detection and prevention system.

Example: Credit Card Detection
With a label that indicates whether a transaction was
fraudulent -> supervised analytics that classify an
instance as being fraudulent or not.
Such models may be interpreted to understand the
underlying credit card fraud behavior patterns:
● Small purchase followed by a big one.
● Large number of online purchases in a short period.
● Spending as much as possible as quickly as possible.
● Spending smaller amounts, spread across time.
112

Graph/Network analysis
Extends the abilities of the fraud-detection system by
learning and detecting characteristics of fraudulent
behavior in a network of linked entities.
Including an extra source of information in the analysis,
being the relationships between entities, it contributes in
uncovering particular patterns indicating fraud.

113

Developing a fraud-detection system
1. Expert-based rule engine
2. Unsupervised learning systems
3. Supervised learning systems
The exact order of adopting the different
techniques depend on the characteristics of
the type of fraud.
114

Challenges of developing
fraud-detection models

● Dynamic nature of fraud
● Good detection power
● Skewness of the data
● Operational Efficiency
○ Big Data management

115

Frauds are a dynamic phenomenon
Fraudsters
● Adapt their approaches to commit fraud without being
exposed
○ Probe fraud-detection and prevention systems
■ to understand their functioning
■ to discover their weaknesses

● Develop advanced strategies to cover/blend in their
tracks to avoid being detected ~ camouflage
Need for adaptive analytical models for detection and
prevention to detect and resolve fraud as soon as possible.
116

Good detection power
Detect fraud as accurately as possible
● Low false negative rate (i.e., missed frauds),
especially involving large amounts (high financial
impact)
● Low false alarm rate, to avoid harassing good
customers and prevent accounts or transactions to be
blocked unnecessarily
117

Skewness of the data
Skewness = Plenty of historical examples of
non-fraudulent cases, but only a limited number of
fraudulent cases
Needle-in-a-haystack problem
might cause an analytical technique to experience
difficulties in learning an accurate model.

118

Operational Efficiency
Limited amount of time available to reach a decision
and let a transaction pass or not
● clearly impacts the design of
○ the operational IT systems
○ the analytical model.

Must be able to deal with the massive volumes of data
● The analytical model should not take too long to be
evaluated.
● The information or the variables used by the model should
not take too long to be gathered or calculated.

127

Regular update of the model
A regular update of the model is recommendable given the
dynamic nature of fraud
The frequency of retraining or updating the detection
model depends on several factors:
○ The volatility of the fraud behavior.
○ The detection power of the current model.
○ The amount of (similar) confirmed cases already
available in the database.
○ The rate at which new cases are being confirmed.
○ The required effort to retrain the model.

Reinforcement learning = continuously updates the
detection model by learning from the newest observations

The Fraud Analytics Process Model
Additional transformations: binning, alphanumeric to numeric
coding, geographical aggregation, and so on.

135

The Fraud Analytics Process Model
The analytical model is estimated on the preprocessed and
transformed data.
The actual fraud-detection model is built.

136

The Fraud Analytics Process Model
The model is interpreted and evaluated by the fraud experts.

137

Discussion: Possible Analysis
Output
● Trivial fraudulent patterns = Validation of
the model
● Unknown patterns = “knowledge
diamonds” = provide added insight and
detection power
Once the analytical model has been appropriately validated
and approved, it can be put into production.

138

Additional Consideration
How to represent the model output in a user-friendly way?
How to integrate it with other applications?
How to make sure the analytical model is appropriately
monitored and back tested on an ongoing basis?

139

Key characteristics of successful
fraud analytics models
A fraud-detection model must be thoroughly evaluated
before being adopted.

Key characteristics of successful fraud analytics models
● Statistical accuracy
● Interpretability
● Operational efficiency
● Economical cost
● Regulatory compliance
140

Statistical accuracy (+ significance)
Detection power and correctness of the statistical model
in flagging suspicious cases.
● Different Metrics
We need to make sure that the model generalizes well and
is not overfitted to the historical data set

141

Interpretability
When a deeper understanding of the detected frauds is
required, a fraud-detection model must be
interpretable.
Model’s interpretability depends on the technique used
Open-box models: Allow to understand the underlying
reasons why the model signals a case to be suspicious.
Closed-box models: complex, non interpretable models.
142

Operational efficiency
Time and effort that is required to
● collect and preprocess the data;
● to evaluate the model;
● monitor and backtest the model, and re-estimate it;
● to evaluate whether a case is suspicious or not.
When cases need to be evaluated in real time - >
operational efficiency is crucial and is a main concern
during model performance assessment.

143

Fraud Detection Costs
Developing and implementing a fraud-detection model
involves a significant cost to an organization
● To gather, preprocess, and analyze the data.
● To put the resulting analytical models into production.
● The software, human, and computing resources.
● External data to enrich the available in-house data.
Cost-benefit analysis to gain insight of the returns on
investment of building an advanced fraud-detection system.

144

Security vs. Cost Balance
Direct costs

● Management
● Operational
● Equipment
Indirect costs (more relevant)

● Less usability
● Slower performance
● Less privacy (due to security controls)
● Reduced productivity (users are slower)
145

Fraud Management as "Risk
Management"
Risk: statistical and economical evaluation of the exposure
to damage because of the presence of vulnerabilities and
threats.
Risk = Asset x Vulnerabilities x Threats
controllable variables

independent
variable

Security: balance the

(reduction of vulnerabilities + damage containment)
vs.
(cost)
146

More money =/=> More security
Examples

● Very expensive,
“unconfigured”
Fraud Detection
System
○ Better not to have it

● Complex
authentication that
slows down users
○ Users will write
passwords on
stickies

147

Regulatory compliance
Depending on the context there may be internal or
organization-specific and external regulation that applies to
the development and application of a model.
A fraud-detection model should be in line and comply with
all applicable regulation and legislation.
(e.g., PSD2)
