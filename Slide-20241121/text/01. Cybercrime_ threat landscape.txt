1. Cybercrime: Threat
Landscape
Digital Forensics and Cybercrime course
Prof. Zanero

Recall: Security, Risk, Threat
Risk: statistical and economical evaluation of
the exposure to damage because of the
presence of vulnerabilities and threats.
Risk = Asset x Vulnerabilities x Threats
controllable variables

independent
variable

Security: managing risk vs. cost

Threat landscape
Three “dimensions” for threats:
● Internal vs external
● Generic vs targeted
● Financially motivated vs others

Rise of the Bots
● Abuse of IRC bots (IRCwars):
○ IRCwars: one of the first documented DDoS attacks

● 1999: trinoo "DDoS attack tool"
○ originally ran on Solaris (later ported to Windows)
○ setup of the botnet was mostly manual
○ August 1999: DDoS attack against a server at
University of Minnesota using at least 227 bots
(http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/trinoo.analysis)

● 2000s: DDoS attacks against high profile
websites (Amazon, CNN, eBay) got huge
media coverage
