10. Cloud Forensics
Digital Forensics and Cybercrime course
Prof. Zanero

Enter the cloud problem
● Cloud computing is a computing-as-a-service paradigm
○ Different declinations: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
● We will deal mainly with the concept of public clouds as private
clouds offer significantly less challenges
● Issues with acquisition and access to evidence
● Analysis issues
● Issues with attribution (multi-tenancy systems and networks)
● Issues of legal status

Acquisition issues
● In general, even in IaaS scenarios, no control is given to user on
hardware and storage space
○ Investigators cannot really access the metal
○ This makes traditional acquisition procedures unfeasible for the
host
(http://www.dfrws.org/2012/proceedings/DFRWS2012-10.pdf
demonstrates feasibility for guests)
● Levels of access vary:
○ SaaS: cloud service provider only one who has logs/data
○ PaaS: customer may have application log, network log,
database log, or operating system depend on the CSP
○ IaaS: logs until OS level accessible to customers; network/
process logs at provider level (e.g. load balancer logs)

The real cloud issue
● Data in flux
○ Some data only exists as result of
transaction
○ E.g. case of reconstructing page of Youtube
video
○ “There is no data”

4

Acquisition issues (even on simple
cases)
● Acquisition of a simple web page
○ What could possibly go wrong?
● Dynamic content on page
○ How to capture?
○ How to reproduce in court?
○ If imported from external sites, what is its legal status?
● Visualization is different from data
● Attribution
○ Whois data
○ DNS resolution (proving it from multiple points)
○ Connectivity and provider identification
○ Geolocation of hoster
5

Analysis issues
● Main expectation of forensics: retrieval of deleted data/fragments of
data
○ Basically impossible in a cloud environment
● Metadata will disappear easily
○ Snapshots and restores
● Investigation of hypervisor-level compromises
○ Lack of tools and research

6

Attribution issues
● In cyberspace, attribution is hard already
○ Spoofing at IP level
○ Usage of stepping stones (i.e. attribution to technical source is
not attribution to agent)
● Cloud infrastructures add an additional layer of indirection in
attribution
○ Identity?
○ Actor?
○ Location?

7

Legal issues
● Geographic location
○ Some judiciary acts require a physical location
○ Criminal investigation/prosecution based on physical locations
○ Applicable law depends on physical location
● Electronic data is unique as it may actually span multiple physical
locations!
○ No other artifact has, or ever had, this property
● Under “Budapest convention” support for the concept of “Electronic
Search and Seizure”
○ Cross border?
○ Removal of obstacles (i.e. legal forceful access to systems)
cannot be ordered across countries
● Contract and SLA issues with CSP

Legal issues: clouds of clouds of
clouds...

Forensically-enabled clouds
● Drivers (why should a CSP care?)
○ SOX requires auditable storage for storage of
financial and accounting data
○ HIPAA requires forensic capabilities for storage of
healthcare data

● Requirements for a CSP to offer “forensic
friendly” services
○ Make an effort to store (snapshots of) volatile VM
data in their infrastructure
○ Make an effort to provide proof of past data
possession
○ Data location (?)
○ Identity Management
○ Encryption and Key Management
○ Legal provision and SLAs
10

Dual considerations: cloud enabled
forensics
● Drivers (why should we care?)
○ Data storage size constantly increasing
○ Analysis of large amount of data takes months or years
on standard computing hardware
○ “Needle in haystack” issue

● What would be the benefits?
○ Large scale data storage
○ Large scale computing infrastructure
○ Reuse of computing concepts (e.g. map-reduce, etc.)

● What are the challenges?
○ Loss of control on evidence (privacy issues)
○ Chain of custody (same challenges as for acquisition)
○ Transnational operations are challenging from legal
perspective
