# 01. Cybercrime: Threat Landscape

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Key Concepts**
- **Risk and Security:**
  - **Risk:** Statistical and economic evaluation of exposure to damage due to vulnerabilities and threats. Formula:  
    `Risk = Asset x Vulnerabilities x Threats`
  - **Security:** Managing risk vs. cost.

- **Threat Landscape Dimensions:**
  - Internal vs. External
  - Generic vs. Targeted
  - Financially Motivated vs. Other motivations

- **Types of Threats (Gartner Quadrant):**
  - **Internal (Generic):** Disgruntled employees.
  - **Internal (Specific):** Socially-engineered or dishonest employees.
  - **External (Generic):** Criminals seeking monetary gain.
  - **External (Specific):** Advanced attackers with varied objectives.

### 2. **Malicious Software and Attack Trends**
- **Evolution of Malware:**
  - From opportunistic attacks to high-profile, politically motivated, or espionage-focused operations.
  - Rise of organized groups and nation-states as actors.

- **Financially-Oriented Malware:**
  - **Direct Monetization:**
    - Credit card/bank fraud
    - Ransomware
    - Fake antivirus software
    - Premium calls (nearly obsolete)
  - **Indirect Monetization:**
    - Data harvesting
    - Resource abuse (e.g., botnets)
    - Renting or selling botnet infrastructures

- **Ransomware History:**
  - Key milestones (1996 to present)
  - Examples: CryptoLocker, WannaCry

### 3. **Botnets**
- **Historical Development:**
  - 1999: "Trinoo" DDoS tool used for large-scale attacks.
  - 2000s: High-profile DDoS attacks against Amazon, CNN, eBay.
- **Botnet Evolution:**
  - Geographically dispersed command and control (C&C) infrastructure.

### 4. **Cybercrime Ecosystem**
- Organized groups specialize in:
  - Exploit development
  - Victim monitoring
  - Selling exploit kits (often with support services)
- Monetization via the **dark web**:
  - Exploit kit sales
  - Money laundering through "money mules"

## üìñ Study Strategy Guide

1. **Understand the Terminology:**
   - Focus on key terms: risk, threat landscape dimensions, ransomware, botnets, and cybercrime ecosystem.

2. **Visualize the Gartner Quadrant:**
   - Internal vs. External and Generic vs. Targeted threats.

3. **Follow the Historical Context:**
   - Evolution of ransomware and botnets provides critical insights into current trends.

4. **Connect Concepts:**
   - Relate financially motivated attacks to their technical execution (e.g., ransomware mechanisms, botnet structures).

## üìù Answers to Exam Questions

1. **What are the three dimensions of the threat landscape?** <a name="q1"></a>  
   **Answer:** Internal vs. External, Generic vs. Targeted, Financially Motivated vs. Other motivations.

2. **Define the formula for risk and explain its components.** <a name="q2"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   Risk = Asset x Vulnerabilities x Threats.  
   - **Assets:** Valuable resources.  
   - **Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in the system.  
   - **Threats:** Potential exploit scenarios.

3. **How have ransomware attacks evolved since the 1990s?** <a name="q3"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   - Early prototypes (1996) focused on experimentation.  
   - Modern ransomware (e.g., CryptoLocker, WannaCry) uses advanced encryption mechanisms.  
   - Shift towards high-profile targets and direct monetization.

4. **Discuss the roles of botnets in the cybercrime ecosystem.** <a name="q4"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   Botnets are used for:  
   - DDoS attacks  
   - Resource abuse (e.g., computational power)  
   - Renting out infrastructure for malicious activities.

5. **Give examples of direct and indirect monetization strategies used by financially motivated attackers.** <a name="q5"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Direct Monetization:** Credit card fraud, ransomware, fake antivirus software.  
   - **Indirect Monetization:** Data harvesting, botnet rentals.

6. **What was the significance of "Blackhole"?** <a name="q6"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   Blackhole was a famous exploit kit authored by Dmitry "Paunch" Fedotov. It enabled large-scale cybercrime operations until his arrest in 2013.
