# 11. Incident Response

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Definition of Security Incident**
- Threatens core security services:
  - Confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, authenticity, reliability.

---

### 2. **Incident Response Objectives**
- Develop procedures for managing incidents.
- Reflect on potential impacts and allow suitable responses.

---

### 3. **Incident Response Capability Benefits**
- Systematic response minimizes losses and disruptions.
- Handles legal implications effectively.
- Uses incident handling insights for:
  - Improved preparation.
  - Stronger protection.

### 4. **Case Study: Mass Email Worm Infection**
- **Impact:**
  - Cripples intranet and internet connections.
  - Major operational disruptions.
- **Response:**
  - Disconnect from the Internet.
  - Shut down internal email.
  - Balance functionality loss against system compromise.
- **Key Policy Elements:**
  - Severity-based actions.
  - Defined personnel roles and contact protocols.

---

### 5. **Managing Security Incidents**
- Key Steps:
  - Detect incidents.
  - Categorize and prioritize.
  - Respond to breaches.
  - Document breaches for future reference.

---

### 6. **Key Terminology**
- **Artifact:** Evidence of probing or attacks.
- **CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team):**
  - Detects and mitigates incidents, restores services.
- **Constituency:** Group served by CSIRT.
- **Triage:** Sorting and prioritizing incident information.
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness allowing exploitation.

---

### 7. **Incident Detection Methods**
- **Manual Reports:** Encourage user training.
- **Automated Tools:**
  - System integrity verification.
  - Log analysis.
  - Intrusion detection and prevention systems.

---

### 8. **Advantages of Automated Tools**
- Tracks evolving threats.
- Reduces delayed response risks.
- Requires updates and accurate configurations.

---

### 9. **Response Procedures**
- Identify causes and incident type.
- Contact decision-makers.
- Recover and gather evidence.
- Report breaches to third parties, if necessary.

---

### 10. **Incident Handling Life Cycle**
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify vulnerabilities.
  2. Record incident details.
  3. Reassess risk profiles.

---

### 11. **Information Flow in Incident Handling**
- Services include:
  - **Announcements:** Current attack warnings.
  - **Vulnerability Handling:** Protective measures.
  - **Education:** Training and knowledge sharing.
  - **Intrusion Detection Services:** Attack profiling.
  - **Risk Analysis:** Threat and loss statistics.
