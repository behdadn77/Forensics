# 04. Machine Learning for Fraud Detection

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Key Concepts**
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Real data is often "dirty" with inconsistencies, incompleteness, and duplication.
  - Requires cleaning and filtering to ensure the validity of analytical models.

- **Sampling and Bias:**  
  - Sampling must be representative of future entities and consider seasonality effects to avoid bias.

- **Types of Learning Techniques:**  
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Detects anomalies without labels, focusing on deviations from the norm.
  - **Supervised Learning:** Uses historical labeled data to classify instances as fraudulent or not.

- **Advanced Techniques:**  
  - Clustering, PCA, and Neural Networks for uncovering hidden patterns and outliers.
  - Ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forests for robust predictions.

- **Fraud Detection in Skewed Datasets:**  
  - Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle imbalance.

## üìù Answers to Exam Questions

1. **Why is data preprocessing essential in fraud detection?** <a name="q1"></a>  
   **Answer:** Preprocessing cleans messy data by addressing inconsistencies, incompleteness, and duplication. This step ensures the data is usable, valid, and yields accurate analytical models.

2. **Compare supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for fraud detection.** <a name="q2"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Supervised Learning:** Requires labeled data and focuses on known fraud patterns. Suitable for classification and prediction tasks.  
   - **Unsupervised Learning:** Detects unknown anomalies without labels, useful for discovering novel fraud patterns.

3. **What are the challenges of handling skewed datasets in fraud detection?** <a name="q3"></a>  
   **Answer:** Skewed datasets result in models biased toward the majority class, often missing minority (fraudulent) cases. Addressing this requires techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE.

4. **Explain how SMOTE improves fraud detection in imbalanced datasets.** <a name="q4"></a>  
   **Answer:** SMOTE creates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority observations and their nearest neighbors, balancing the dataset without duplicating entries.

5. **Describe the steps in the fraud detection process using ensemble methods.** <a name="q5"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   - Use bootstrapping (Bagging) or reweighting (Boosting) to create multiple models.  
   - Combine outputs through voting (classification) or averaging (regression).  
   - Random Forests enhance performance by combining diverse decision trees.

6. **How does PCA help in reducing data dimensionality?** <a name="q6"></a>  
   **Answer:** PCA transforms correlated variables into uncorrelated principal components, summarizing the variance in fewer dimensions, which simplifies models and improves stability.
