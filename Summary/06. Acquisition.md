## ðŸ“‹ Summary

### 1. **Global and Legal Perspectives**
- **Varied Legal Systems**:
  - **USA**: Focus on "chain of custody" and evidence admissibility.
  - **Italy**: Judges evaluate evidence, emphasizing procedural correctness.
- **International Regulations**:
  - **Budapest Convention**: Cybercrime guidelines applicable in CoE states.
  - **ISO Standards**:
    - ISO/IEC 27037: Identification and preservation of digital evidence.
    - ISO/IEC 27035: Information security incident management.
  - **IETF Guidelines**: Evidence collection and archiving (RFC 3227).

### 2. **Challenges with Digital Evidence**
- **Brittleness**:  
  - Digital evidence is fragile and not inherently tamper-evident.
  - Requires procedures to detect manipulation and ensure integrity.
- **Hashing**:
  - Hashes like MD5 and SHA-256 verify the authenticity of digital evidence.
  - Limitations:
    - Do not account for actions prior to hashing.
    - Must be securely recorded (e.g., signed reports or digital signatures).

### 3. **Hardware and Software for Acquisition**
- **Hardware**:
  - Write blockers, external drives, USB/SATA connectors, removable HD enclosures.
- **Preferred Operating System**:
  - Linux for non-intrusive drive access and extensive file system support.
- **Bitstream Images**:
  - Bit-by-bit cloning (forensic clones) to preserve unallocated and metadata.

### 4. **Acquisition Procedure**
1. Disconnect media from the original system (if possible).  
2. Connect the media to the analysis system using a **write blocker**.  
3. Compute a hash of the source media:
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/sda conv=noerror,sync | sha256sum
   ```
4. Create a forensic clone of the media:
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/acquisition.img conv=noerror,sync
   ```
5. Compute hashes for the source and clone.  
6. Compare all hashes to verify integrity.

### 5. **Key Challenges**
- **Time**:
  - Large drives (e.g., 1TB) can take hours to copy or hash.
  - Tools like `dcfldd` automate hashing and copying in parallel:
    ```bash
    dcfldd if=/dev/sda hash=md5,sha256 md5log=md5.txt sha256log=sha256.txt of=/tmp/acquisition.img hashconv=after bs=512 conv=noerror,sync
    ```
- **Size**:
  - Use **NAS** or **SAN** for scalable storage in large investigations.
  - Transfer images over networks using tools like `nc`:
    ```bash
    nc -lp 5678 > /tmp/acquisition.img
    dd if=/dev/sda conv=noerror,sync | nc -p 5678 <address>
    ```
- **Encryption**:
  - Increasing use of encryption complicates acquisition.
  - Repeatable methods are critical for compliance.

### 6. **Alternate Acquisition Methods**
1. **Booting with Forensic Linux Distributions**:
   - Use live distros like **Tsurugi** or **BackBox** for in-system acquisition.
2. **Powered-On Target**:
   - Capture volatile data (e.g., memory dumps) before disk imaging.
   - Prioritize:
     1. Memory dump.
     2. Network/process data.
     3. Disk acquisition.
3. **Live Network Analysis**:
   - Observe attackers in real-time (e.g., honeypots).
   - Focus on:
     - Logs.
     - Network traffic.

### 7. **Future Challenges**
- **Cloud Forensics**: Handling distributed and virtual environments.
- **Mobile Devices**: Tackling encryption and proprietary systems.
- **SSD Peculiarities**: Wear leveling and garbage collection impact analysis.
