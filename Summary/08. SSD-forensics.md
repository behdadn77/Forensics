# 08. SSD Forensics

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Introduction**
- **SSD Technology:**
  - Uses NAND-based flash memory.
  - Increasingly popular due to cost efficiency and performance.
- **Challenges in Forensics:**
  - SSD-specific features like the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) complicate data acquisition and analysis.
  - Traditional tools are often ineffective due to the opaque nature of SSD internals.

---

### 2. **Key SSD Features Impacting Forensics**
- **Flash Translation Layer (FTL):**
  - Maps logical block addresses (LBA) to physical block addresses (PBA).
  - May modify data transparently, even without OS interaction.
- **Forensically Relevant Functions:**
  - **TRIM:** Preemptive block erasure reduces recoverable data.
  - **Garbage Collection:** Removes unused data blocks automatically.
  - **Compression:** Alters data to save space, complicating recovery.
  - **Wear Leveling:** Spreads write cycles evenly, making data recovery unpredictable.

---

### 3. **Testing Methodology**
- **Goals:**
  - Assess how FTL impacts black-box forensic tools.
  - Evaluate the viability of white-box approaches.
- **Tests Conducted:**
  - **TRIM Testing:** Analyze how TRIM erases data across different percentages and filesystems.
  - **Garbage Collection Testing:** Verify if SSDs perform garbage collection and under what conditions.
  - **Erasing Patterns:** Detect peculiar behaviors in block erasure.
  - **Compression:** Measure the effects of transparent compression.
  - **Wear Leveling:** Check for write amplification and its forensic implications.
  - **File Recoverability:** Test file recovery success rates post-deletion.

### 4. **Results**
- **TRIM:**
  - Aggressively erases data within seconds in most cases.
  - Ext4 filesystems often erase data only after unmounting.
- **Garbage Collection:**
  - Rarely observed in practice during testing.
- **Compression:**
  - Found in some SSDs (e.g., Corsair) but not universal.
- **Wear Leveling:**
  - Write amplification is not externally observable, limiting forensic value.
- **File Recoverability:**
  - Drives with aggressive TRIM implementations show near-zero recovery rates.
  - Some exceptions (e.g., Corsair F60 on NTFS) allow partial recovery.

### 5. **Challenges in SSD Forensics**
- **Bypassing FTL:**
  - Requires expensive and time-consuming methods, such as physical chip extraction.
  - Risks damaging evidence irreparably.
- **Forensic Limitations:**
  - Variability in SSD behavior due to firmware, OS, and filesystem differences.
  - Lack of public documentation and tools for SSD-specific features.

---

### 6. **Conclusion**
- SSDs introduce features that disrupt traditional forensic processes.
- A triage methodology helps assess potential success and limitations of forensic efforts.
- Collaboration between forensic experts, hardware vendors, and researchers is necessary for better tools and processes.
