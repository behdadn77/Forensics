# 10. Cloud Forensics

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Cloud Forensics Context**
- **Cloud Computing Paradigm:** Computing-as-a-service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
- **Focus:** Public clouds (more challenging than private clouds).
- **Key Issues:**
  - Evidence acquisition and access.
  - Analysis complexities.
  - Attribution problems in multi-tenant systems.
  - Legal and jurisdictional challenges.

---

### 2. **Acquisition Challenges**
- **Control Limitations:**
  - Users often lack hardware and storage access.
  - Investigators cannot access the physical layer (‚Äúmetal‚Äù).
- **Access Levels by Model:**
  - **SaaS:** Only CSP has logs/data.
  - **PaaS:** Access to application, network, database, or OS logs varies.
  - **IaaS:** Limited to OS-level logs; provider retains network/process logs.
- **Dynamic Data:**
  - Transactional data (e.g., YouTube page reconstruction) may not persist.
  - Legal and forensic reproducibility issues.

### 3. **Analysis Challenges**
- **Data Retrieval:** Recovery of deleted or fragmented data is nearly impossible.
- **Metadata Loss:** Easily vanishes with snapshots/restores.
- **Hypervisor Compromises:** Tools and research are lacking.

---

### 4. **Attribution Issues**
- **General Challenges:**
  - Spoofing and use of intermediaries obscure agents.
  - Attribution involves actor, identity, and location layers.
- **Cloud-Specific Challenges:**
  - Added indirection layers due to infrastructure complexity.

---

### 5. **Legal Challenges**
- **Geographic Dependencies:**
  - Physical locations often required by laws.
  - Data may span multiple jurisdictions, complicating enforcement.
- **Budapest Convention:**
  - Supports electronic search and seizure but struggles with cross-border limitations.
- **Contracts and SLAs:**
  - Agreements with CSPs can create legal ambiguities.

---

### 6. **Forensically-Enabled Clouds**
- **Drivers for CSPs:**
  - SOX: Auditable storage for financial records.
  - HIPAA: Forensic capabilities for healthcare data.
- **Requirements:**
  - Store volatile VM data snapshots.
  - Provide proof of past data possession.
  - Identity and encryption management.
  - Address legal provisions in SLAs.

---

### 7. **Cloud-Enabled Forensics**
- **Motivations:**
  - Growing data sizes and processing needs.
  - Long analysis times on standard hardware.
- **Benefits:**
  - Scalable data storage and computation.
  - Reuse of computing frameworks (e.g., MapReduce).
- **Challenges:**
  - Loss of evidence control.
  - Chain of custody issues.
  - Legal barriers in transnational operations.
