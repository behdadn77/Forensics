# 02. Cryptocurrencies: Abuses and Forensics

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Key Concepts**
- **Bitcoin Basics:**
  - A decentralized payment system and tool for storing, verifying, and auditing information.
  - Transactions recorded in a blockchain‚Äîa distributed, append-only ledger.
  - Proof-of-Work (PoW) solves the Byzantine Problem and ensures consensus.

- **Bitcoin Wallets and Addresses:**
  - A wallet manages public and private keys, signs transactions, and tracks balances.
  - Bitcoin addresses (26‚Äì35 alphanumeric characters) serve as unique identifiers for receiving payments.

- **Blockchain and Mining:**
  - Blocks group transactions within a timeframe; the blockchain links these blocks in a distributed ledger.
  - Miners solve complex math problems to validate blocks, earning BTC as a reward.
  - Mining difficulty adjusts every 10 minutes based on competition.

### 2. **Criminal Use Cases**
- **Pseudo-Anonymity:**
  - Transactions lack direct identifiers, but correlation of addresses can deanonymize users.
  - Transactions can be analyzed due to public ledger transparency.
  
- **Silk Road Case Study:**
  - Silk Road, a dark web marketplace, was shut down after investigators traced transactions linked to Ross Ulbricht, the operator (Dread Pirate Roberts).
  - Techniques included address tracking, transaction flow analysis, and leveraging public data.

- **Hopping and Mixing:**
  - Criminals obscure transaction origins by mixing coins or hopping through multiple addresses.
  
- **Advanced Anonymity:**
  - Cryptocurrencies like Monero offer stronger anonymity, complicating forensics.
  - Wannacry ransomware operators converted Bitcoin to Monero via ShapeShift.

### 3. **Ransomware and Payments**
- **CryptoLocker (2013):**
  - Encrypted victims' files and demanded Bitcoin ransoms.
  - Payment amounts decreased over time but still amassed significant funds.

## üìù Answers to Exam Questions

1. **Define Bitcoin and explain its core functionalities.** <a name="q1"></a>  
   **Answer:** Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system and tool for storing, verifying, and auditing information. Its blockchain ledger records all transactions, ensuring transparency and security via Proof-of-Work.

2. **What is a Bitcoin wallet, and what are its key roles?** <a name="q2"></a>  
   **Answer:** A wallet manages public and private keys, creates and signs transactions, and tracks balances of incoming and outgoing transactions.

3. **How does Proof-of-Work solve the Byzantine Problem?** <a name="q3"></a>  
   **Answer:** Proof-of-Work requires miners to solve computationally difficult problems, ensuring trust and consensus in a decentralized system by making it costly to alter the blockchain.

4. **Explain how transaction correlations can deanonymize Bitcoin users.** <a name="q4"></a>  
   **Answer:** Multiple inputs in a transaction likely belong to the same user. Bugs or patterns in shadow addresses can reveal ownership, exposing pseudo-anonymity.

5. **Describe how blockchain forensics can be used to track ransomware payments.** <a name="q5"></a>  
   **Answer:** By following transaction flows, investigators can link addresses to payments and identify patterns. Mixing and hopping make this challenging but not impossible.

6. **Discuss the forensic techniques used to investigate Silk Road.** <a name="q6"></a>  
   **Answer:** Techniques included tracing transaction flows, analyzing public postings (e.g., ‚Äúaltoid‚Äù nickname), and identifying linked Bitcoin addresses to trace funds and the operator.
