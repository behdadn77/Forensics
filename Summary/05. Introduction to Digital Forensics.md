### Summary

#### Definition of Digital Forensics
Digital Forensics is the scientific analysis of digital data, computer systems, and network data to reconstruct evidence. It applies the principles of general forensics to the digital domain.

#### Daubert Standard (US)
This standard defines the admissibility of expert testimony in court, specifying that:
1. The testimony must aid the court in understanding the evidence.
2. It must rely on sufficient facts or data.
3. It should stem from reliable principles and methods.
4. The expert must reliably apply these principles to the case.

#### Scientific Method in Forensics
Key principles:
- **Repeatability**: Findings must be reproducible.
- **Falsifiability**: Theories must be disprovable to be scientifically valid.

#### Daubert Test for Scientific Reliability
Factors include:
1. General acceptance within the scientific community.
2. Peer review and publication.
3. Testability of the technique or theory.
4. Acceptable error rates.
5. Independence of the research from litigation purposes.

#### Examples of Forensic Engagements
- **Internal Investigations**: Corporate policy violations, fraud.
- **Criminal Investigations**: Child pornography, cyber extortion.
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Assessing damage after cyberattacks.
- **Research**: Using honeypots to study attacker behavior.

#### Four Phases of an Investigation (Pollitt, 1995)
1. **Source Acquisition**: Collecting potential evidence.
2. **Evidence Identification**: Determining relevance.
3. **Evaluation**: Validating and analyzing evidence.
4. **Presentation**: Structuring findings for legal proceedings.

### Study Strategy
1. **Understand Key Definitions**: Focus on how digital forensics extends the principles of general forensics.
2. **Learn the Daubert Standard**: Pay attention to its components and applicability in court.
3. **Master the Scientific Principles**: Grasp repeatability and falsifiability as foundational.
4. **Know Forensic Engagement Types**: Relate real-world examples to theoretical principles.
5. **Memorize the Investigation Phases**: Understand the logical flow from evidence collection to presentation.

#### Answers
1. **What is the primary goal of digital forensics?**  
   To apply scientific methods to digital data to reconstruct evidence and assist in investigations.

2. **What are the criteria outlined by the Daubert standard for expert testimony?**  
   - Relevance and reliability.
   - Peer-reviewed and published methods.
   - Testability.
   - Acceptable error rates.
   - Independence from litigation.

3. **Why are repeatability and falsifiability essential in the scientific method?**  
   Repeatability ensures findings can be reproduced, while falsifiability ensures theories can be tested and potentially disproven, which are core principles of science.

4. **What are some examples of forensic engagements?**  
   - Internal investigations: Fraud, policy violations.
   - Criminal investigations: Child pornography, cyber extortion.
   - Post-mortem analyses: Damage assessment.
   - Research: Honeypot experiments.

5. **List and briefly describe the four phases of a forensic investigation.**  
   - **Source Acquisition**: Collecting evidence sources.  
   - **Evidence Identification**: Determining relevance.  
   - **Evaluation**: Validating and analyzing evidence.  
   - **Presentation**: Structuring findings for legal use.
