# 05. Introduction to Digital Forensics

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Definition and Scope**
- **Digital Forensics**:
  - Application of scientific methods to digital data, computer systems, and network data for reconstructing evidence.
- **General Forensics**:
  - Application of scientific analysis methods to reconstruct evidence across various domains.

---

### 2. **The Daubert Standard (US)**
- Established to determine the admissibility of expert testimony in court (Rule 702).  
- **Requirements for Expert Testimony**:
  1. Based on sufficient facts or data.
  2. Product of reliable principles and methods.
  3. Reliably applied to the facts of the case.
  4. Must help the trier of fact understand evidence or determine facts.

---

### 3. **Scientific Method and Forensics**
- **Key Features**:
  - **Repeatability**: Findings can be repeated under the same conditions (Galileo, 1650).
  - **Falsifiability**: Statements must be testable and disprovable to qualify as scientific (Popper, 1934).

---

### 4. **Daubert Test for "Scientific" Evidence**
Factors considered:
1. General acceptance in the scientific community.
2. Subjected to peer review and publication.
3. Testable and tested.
4. Known/potential error rates are acceptable.
5. Research conducted independently of litigation motives.

---

### 5. **Examples of Forensic Engagements**
- **Situations**:
  - Internal investigations (e.g., policy violations).
  - Criminal investigations (defense or prosecution).
  - Post-mortem analysis for damage assessment or recovery strategy.
- **Crimes**:
  - Fraud, child pornography, cyber extortion, espionage, copyright infringement.

---

### 6. **Phases of an Investigation**
1. **Source Acquisition**: Identify and collect data from relevant sources.
2. **Evidence Identification**: Locate and recognize potential evidence.
3. **Evaluation**: Analyze the evidence for reliability and relevance.
4. **Presentation**: Document findings and present them in court or reports.

## üìñ Study Strategy Guide

1. **Understand the Daubert Standard**: Focus on the criteria for admissible testimony and its connection to the scientific method. 
2. **Master Forensic Process**: Know the four investigation phases and their real-world applications.
3. **Memorize Key Forensic Engagements**: Be prepared to discuss examples like fraud or cyber extortion.
4. **Connect Theory to Practice**: Use examples like "repeatability" and "falsifiability" to explain scientific methodology.

## üìù Answers to Exam Questions

1. **What is the Daubert Standard and its relevance in digital forensics?** <a name="q1"></a>  
   **Answer:** The Daubert Standard ensures that expert testimony is relevant and reliable, focusing on principles like peer review, error rates, and testability. It is crucial in digital forensics to validate evidence scientifically.

2. **Why is falsifiability important in the scientific method?** <a name="q2"></a>  
   **Answer:** Falsifiability ensures that a hypothesis can be tested and disproven, making it a fundamental criterion for distinguishing scientific statements from non-scientific ones.

3. **Explain the phases of a digital forensic investigation.** <a name="q3"></a>  
   **Answer:**  
   1. **Source Acquisition**: Collect data.  
   2. **Evidence Identification**: Locate potential evidence.  
   3. **Evaluation**: Analyze reliability and relevance.  
   4. **Presentation**: Report findings in court or documentation.

4. **How do general acceptance and error rates affect the admissibility of forensic evidence?** <a name="q4"></a>  
   **Answer:** Evidence must be widely accepted in the scientific community and have acceptable error rates to ensure reliability and credibility in court.

5. **Provide examples of forensic engagements and their challenges.** <a name="q5"></a>  
   **Answer:** Examples include fraud investigations and cyber extortion cases. Challenges involve ensuring data integrity, meeting legal standards, and handling complex evidence.

6. **Discuss the importance of repeatability in digital forensics.** <a name="q6"></a>  
   **Answer:** Repeatability ensures consistent results when forensic techniques are applied under the same conditions, strengthening the credibility of findings.
