# 07. Identification

## üìã Summary

### 1. **Forensic Toolsets**
- **Preferred OS: Linux**
  - Native support for diverse filesystems.
  - Allows drive hot-swapping, image mounting, and advanced recovery tools.
- **Virtualization:**
  - Windows as a guest OS for tools specific to it.
  - Filesystems can be mounted as read-only under Linux and accessed via Samba.

---

### 2. **Why Not Windows?**
- Modifies evidence by default.
- Limited support for image handling and non-Windows filesystems.
- Windows is confined to guest environments for specific tools, using non-persistent virtualization modes when necessary.

---

### 3. **Scientific Standards in Forensics**
- **Repeatability:**
  - Other experts should reproduce identical results.
- **Analysis Logic:**
  - Beyond tool outputs; manual verification is essential.
- **Open Source Preference:**
  - Proprietary tools often lack transparency and accessibility.

---

### 4. **Data Recovery**
- **Common Scenarios:**
  - Deleted files, formatted drives, damaged sectors.
- **OS Behavior on File Deletion:**
  - Deletes file system entries but leaves actual data blocks until overwritten.
- **Slack Space:**
  - Fragments of deleted files can remain in unallocated or slack space.

---

### 5. **File Recovery via Carving**
- Scans entire drives as bitstreams.
- Identifies files based on headers and footers.
- **Challenges:**
  - Fragmentation.
  - Encryption and compression without metadata.

---

### 6. **Free Tools for Recovery**
- **TSK & Autopsy:**
  - Comprehensive recovery and timeline creation.
- **Foremost:**
  - File recovery using carving techniques.
- **gpart/testdisk:**
  - Partition recovery.
- **PhotoRec:** 
  - Specialized for media file recovery.

---

### 7. **Anti-Forensics Techniques**
- **Transient Techniques:**
  - Lead analysts off-track; detectable if scrutinized.
- **Definitive Techniques:**
  - Destroy evidence permanently or render it unreliable.
- **Examples:**
  - Timeline tampering with MAC timestamps (e.g., timestomp).
  - Secure deletion tools like sdelete.

---

### 8. **Advanced Techniques**
- **Fileless Attacks:**
  - Inject malicious code into memory; leave no disk traces.
  - Requires in-memory forensics tools like memdump and Volatility.
- **Filesystem Insertion/Subversion:**
  - Hides data in metadata, bad blocks, or journal spaces (e.g., WaffenFS, RuneFS).
- **Log Injection:**
  - Exploits log analysis scripts by injecting misleading or harmful data.

---

### 9. **Partition-Based Tricks**
- Misalign partitions to escape detection.
- Create excessive logical partitions to overwhelm tools.
