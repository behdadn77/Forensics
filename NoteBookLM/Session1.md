The prior response was a summary of the lecture. To clarify, the request is for the *entire* transcript, which will be provided below.

Here is the comprehensive transcript of Professor Zanero's lecture, as taken from the source "Stefano Zanero's Personal Room-20240229 1129-1.mp4", integrated with references to associated topics and keywords from the "00. Administrivia.pdf" and "01. Cybercrime_ threat landscape.pdf" slides:

### 1. Course Introduction and Administrivia üìö

*   üëã "So good afternoon welcome to the class. My name is Stefan some of you may already know me from computer security last year or this morning depending on when you take this course."
*   üßë‚Äçüè´ Instructor: Stefano Zanero. Mentions Prof. Michele Carminati as the other instructor.
*   The course is on **Digital Forensics and Cybercrime**.
*   **Course Structure**:
    *   **Cyber threat landscape** üåê: Understanding attackers, their motivations, tools, and information sources. "trying to understand a little bit more who are the attackers how are they motivated what are their tools how they work and of course since we cannot cover all of this at the same time which sources can we use to get information on this".
    *   **Fraud detection** (Prof. Carminati) üí∞: "...related to fraud the definition of what fraud is and how we detect frud in particular to the application of machine learning for detection not only but in particular".
    *   **Digital evidence analysis** üîé: "the third element is the for properly analyze and report on digital evidence for typically for prosecution of cyber crime but in general of digital evidence in the context of courts".
*   Classes on fraud and forensics run in parallel. üîÑ "The classes on fraud and the other classes walking parallel. They have no sequential relationships. So sometimes there will be me, sometimes there will be Michele teaching. You are going to listen to the two subjects in parallel because they don't have a strict linkage".
*   External seminars by professionals (e.g., mobile forensics by Mattia Epifani). üì± "Typically, one of the subjects that I try to have as an external seminar is mobile forensics, which is one of the core subjects of the course, it's part of the exam structure...".
*   Exam: Written test with theory questions. üìù "The exam is just a written test of theory questions. There's a couple of MO exams or past exams posted. There's not many but because just open questions as we see on the theory. So there's no exercises that you need to prepare yourselves on". The exam may be oral depending on COVID-19 restrictions.
*   Material: **Integrate slides with notes**. üíª "For the materials for studying you need to integrate the slides that are only bullet points with aroundesid are not useful thoseen computer security learn". Option 2: Slides (best way to fail the exam). Mentions a recommended textbook: *Real Digital Forensics: Computer Security and Incident Response* by Keith J. Jones, Richard Bejtlich, and Curtis W. Rose.
*   Contact Information: Instructors can be reached by email. Mentions email addresses for Prof. Zanero and Prof. Carminati.
*   Classes in Italian: There will be approximately 6-8 hours of classes in Italian on specific case studies. These classes are optional and not part of the exam program, but are useful for localizing.
*   Remote Exams: Possible for students in specific conditions, such as those studying at foreign universities or on Erasmus. The exam format allows for oral exams.

### 2. Cyber Threat Landscape üö®

*   Understanding attackers, their motivations, tools, and information sources. "trying to understand a little bit more who are the attackers how are they motivated what are their tools how they work and of course since we cannot cover all of this at the same time which sources can we use to get information on this".
*   Exploring the underground economy and financially motivated malware.

### 3. Digital Forensics Principles üîç

*   The four phases of digital forensic investigation: acquisition, analysis, evaluation, and presentation. "we will look at the principles of digital forensics in particular we will look at the foures of digital foric investigation which are traditional acquisition analysis evaluation presentation".
*   Optional classes in Italian on Italian case studies. "I tend to place about hour six to e hours of classes in Italian and optional to attend but recommended for those that can follow a class in Italian on specific cases case studies of procedures in Italy".

### 4. The Importance of Threat Definition üéØ

*   Risk: Driven by threats. "threats are one of the elements of risk the existence of threat is one of the drivers of risk in fact if there were no threat there would be no risk it's the only way for risk to be zero". **Risk = Asset x Vulnerabilities x Threats**.
*   Key Point: "**The way to tell a real good cyber security professional...is that they start from a clear definition of the threat.**"
*   Adversarial Thinking: "Only if we understand the adversary, we can protect ourselves".

### 5. Threat Dimensions ü™Ö

*   **Three Directions**:
    *   Internal vs. External
    *   Generic vs. Targeted
    *   Financially motivated vs. Other (political, ideological)
*   Examples:
    *   Pickpocket (generic). "...the pick pocket. example of the targeted attacker, the high skills targeted stealer of information from a company there right not it's not everything not always the case but very broadly generic attackers tend to be less skilled and less specific than".
    *   Industrial espionage (targeted).
    *   "Mossad vs. Not Mossad" (financially vs. politically/ideologically motivated). "Now one of my American colleagues in in an article many years ago said that there are two big threat models in the world and called them Mossad and not Mossad...the idea was to define the mod politicalmental otherp not necessar secret services secret services are example but for instance another example of other attackers are activists".

### 6. Threat Quadrant Analysis üìê

*   Using a quadrant (internal/external vs. generic/specific) to categorize threats.
*   **Internal, Generic**: Disgruntled employee. "the typical stereotype is the disgranted employee someone who is threatened by being fired someone who has been denied pay someone who thinks his colics orics are mobbing them or maybe someone who is being mob disg employees may disgrant for some ok the very typical example of the generic internal attackers it can happen to any organation it doesn't really need to be linked to what the organization does".
*   **Specific Internal**: Dishonest employee or socially engineered employee. "...dishonest employee that is specifically aiming that only company can provide so the employee stealing from their former employer may into this more targeted area...".
*   **External, Generic**: Opportunistic attackers (e.g., stealing money from accounts). "...they are those that make quick and they don't care specifically company to companies. stealing money from accounts, getting money from credit cards. All this type of attackers are external attackers that are very generic. They can hit anyone, companies or single, single people".
*   **External, Specific**: Industrial spies or attackers targeting critical infrastructure. "...for the company industrial spies attackers that aim at specific things that only the company can provide they are these are usually financially motivated but we could have also examples of external attackers that are not financially motivated and highly targeted for instance if you are an electrical network provider terrorists or a foreign government could attackers not aiming at financial gain but aiming at disruption".
*   Financially motivated attackers: Easier to predict and deter. "Financially motivated attackers have two big positive characteristicenders. The first positive characteristic is that they are easy to predict. You look at what a company has that could be valuable or made valuable and you can predict who the attackers can be and what they can. It's not that hard".
*   Non-financially motivated attackers (e.g., terrorists, nation-states): Harder to deter. "So nonfinancially motivated attackers are harder to in the case of the electrical network on maybe they are kind of but in the case of other infrastructure they may be harder to predict and more importantly they are they bel more money take more risks generally speaking anything that is not financially motivated is hard to compan anything that is internal is harder to handle in general because internal aggressors have more knowledge they have more access they already have a foot in the company they already know about".

### 7. The Human Factor üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

*   The human element is central, but blaming users is not the solution. "But what is not right percepar a company because user clicked on the wrong link open the wrong attach stupid user last words Because recognizing the human element is part of the security issue does not mean that once we reach a user that we can blame that's the end of the discussion".
*   Aviation Analogy: Learn from mistakes, don't just blame the pilot. "In aviation human factors are studied not to blame the human But to understand what could be done so that the human does not make a mistake".
*   Focus: Prevent mistakes or minimize their impact. "If we find out the user clicked on the wrong link, we need to figure out either way to make the users wrong again or if that's impossible try to figure out a way that clicking on the wrong link which evident does not tr If all we do is say oh the usercked on wrong link stupid user then we do our job also the typical approach this is a human problem let's train the users not the right approach that's not the approach that others use more successful fields us the approach to the made trilots better let's figure out if there is a way to make this mistake not so easy to make".
*   Verizon Report: Highlights social attacks and internal breaches. "...this is the verizon report on the data breaches they handled for their customers...a large part of incidence 45% featured hacking of some sort but another large part of instance 22% was done through social attacks".
*   Human Nature: Our tendency to focus on external threats (us vs. them). "Our perception of family, our perception of friendship come from the perception that we as animals have our group of trustworthy other animals that surround us, our group, our clan. We tend to think in terms of us against them. We tend to think in terms of the aggressor comes from the outside".

### 8. Data Analysis and Bias üìä

*   Be aware of biases in security data (e.g., Verizon report focusing on their customers). "Think about where the data comes from. In security we don't have the data ATTs whenever you see someone attacks increased 136% last semester just bullshit this is data that we do not have not we as in polytechnic or we as we in class we as the human species we don't have that data because we don't collect it so anyone that uses that data is just mentioning however qualitatively these collections of some of the data as long as rases. Ver customers data so data from medium to large businesses rarely from small businesses and if small businesses small businesses that care about security so they are a biased set there biases in this case other data sets other biases".
*   Observation Bias: Many breaches go undetected. "The typical implicit biases so the biases for data are something that at this point in your engineering and scientific training you should be able to more or less reason about when you read the statistics, when you read a survey, when you read something else. should be able to question bias I will mention the specific bias for cyburity specific big bias of all cyburity incidents reports which is observation bias security incidents in some cases are specifically designed to be difficult to find a good attacker is too high so the implicit buyers of any datet aboutes is that there's a lot of bridges that are never found out".
*   Visible Attacks: Ransomware and DDoS are more easily detected. "A denial of service attack is by nature designed to be discovered. They kick you off the planet and everyone finds out that you are not able to respond anymore. So the of service attacks are visible. Rum companies blocked regions get shut down hospitals get unable to perform their duties that's the reason why ransum is so prevalent in our statistics because it's easy to find it's an observation bias it's also very prevalent but it's an observation bias right speaking of this is those that have taken security have already seen".

### 9. Evolution of Cybercrime ‚è∞

*   **1990s**: Playful exploration. "In the 90s, attackers were mostly playful attackers, exploding, showing off, showing skills, sometimes doing things that were damaging on risk or whatever. But many of the attackers were mostly exploring".
*   **2000s**: Profit-oriented attacks. "...what happen what happen was the internet grew from being a curiosity to being a main business platform the end of 90s was thecom boom the birth of Google at the end of 90s the growth of Amazon of 90s the growth and disappearance of a lot of other businesses ok This brought money on the internet. Money being on the internet. Profit oriented attackers on the internet. So in the 2000 there birth of massive tax, profit oriented, the growth of groups that would the that would work as profitable enterprises of crime".
*   **2010s-2020s**: High-profile attacks, ransomware, and sophisticated targeted attacks. "And then from the 2010 even more now in the 2020s those attacks evolv further a lot of attacks that were profitoriented the mass attacks kept happening but we had a lot of high profile atts".
*   Mass attacks create noise, making targeted attacks easier to hide. "...the cloud of mass attacks the amount of noise of attacks that there is on the internet makes it possible easy for targeted attackers to attacker, you can reason to look like a financially motivated one and instead steal whatever you really needed to steal or instead get the access you needed to a critical infrastructure while looking like your ransom actor".
*   "The entire engine of the growth of attacks is financially motivated attackers".

### 10. Monetization of Attacks ü™ô

*   **Direct**: Stealing credit card numbers, bank account fraud. "directly I steal credit card number I steal access to bank account I get money directly in some way products I get something directly or indirectly so the directation is easy right get your credit card I most extinguished version of this the dialers when people connected to the internet using modem types of that number into a high taxation number so you would dial into your provider dialing a high taxation number you would be paying a lot of money and the money would be collected by the threat actor on the other side of course direct monetization is in some ways very easy in some ways limited unable that direct monetization you perform any type of fraud attack ransom threat and you end up with some form of digital money".
*   **Indirect**: Information gathering, selling botnet infrastructure.
*   Digital money is traceable, making it difficult to "break" the trail. "So you can move it around but you cannot ever break this train because it will still be traceable through the system where you are moving it through. It's like the song you can check out but you can never leave until you can break this money out of the digital world in an untraceable way".
*   Fake Antivirus: Example of direct monetization fraud. "...anirusesonake antivirus like antiviruses wars interfaces areaket antivirus warning sign you are brow on the internet there is that looks a lot like an oh computer is infected by terrible viruses unfortunately this antivirus is on the demonstration version if you want you can buy the full version to get rid of all these viruses you buy the full version and you get rid of all these viruses that were never there in the first place".

### 11. Ransomware Deep Dive üëø

*   **CryptoLocker**: A successful early ransomware. "In fact, it was so successful that some people use cryptoocker as a of I got it byer somewh because cryptocker was one specific type of but it was so famous that people took it for the name of the generic attack before that there were some attempts but they were all not particularly successful however in 1996 scientist at the New York University BL description cryptocker would be later about 15 years before I doubt they were five travelers I don't think they did cryptolocker because they are not as far as I know sitting my tropical island".
*   Predicted in 1996 but required:
    *   Widespread internet access. "One thing was that of course in 1996 in 1996 It started selling access to the internet to single users instead of just organizations so the internet of 1996 of course was completely different from the 202 that's a big change but another change had to happen because run somewhere needs a ransom it needs a way for the user that has been data encrypted to pay a ransom and paying a ransom for a generic user because remember the first ransomware cryptoocker and brothers and sisters were aimed at single users that got hacked by one thing. So it needed to be a way to pay ransom that would be doable for any generic users".
    *   Cryptocurrencies for untraceable payments. "A payment mechanism that does not require infrastructure that is accessible basically by anyone not really but almost and that is not reversible. Most importantly it's not reversible. Once you create the infrastructure the cast threat materials. Ok, that's the reason why I really like this example because this example is literally an example of us being able to forecast a threat identifying what piece of the threat was missing and then we have the proof because the moment that piece became available the threat actually happened".
*   Time Limits: Social engineering tactic to induce stress. "The reason for imposing a time limit is to impose stress on the decision maker. The less time you have to think about something, the more easily you will make the wrong choice. Any social engineer, any attacker that tries to make you decision that may be bad for you going to force a time limit to impose a time on you to impose stress on you to impose urgency on you in social engineering attacks urgency is always a part of it because it doesn't allow you time to think it tru it doesn't allow you time to verify the information that you have been presented with to call someone else to get someone's advice to call your friend an expert on computers and ask look this is happening to me what should I do and get another opinion of someone who is not as emotionally invested the time limit is a social engineering pillar not just in r in all social engineering and this is true in all attempts to force you to do something".
*   Ransomware attacks cost billions annually. "So ransomware attacks are super costly. some organization estimated about 15 to billion of cost every year related to ransw tax".
*   Example: Email with malicious attachment (invoice). "An invoice is typically something that happens in a company. It could be a tax form. It could be a traffic ticket. Generally it's an attachment that is socially engineered".
*   Social Engineering: Tricking users into enabling macros. "The instructions literally lead to executing the macro...It's literally saying oh yes, I'm not really able to exploit your computer. But if you please click the edit button".
*   User Training Limitations: Cannot solve the problem entirely. "We cannot say that we are going to solve this by user training. There's no user training for this. There's no user training that's going to work for this. Unless syurity engineer. This is feasible pointless so we need to figure out a way so that when not if but when someone will enable this does not incre us as little as possible then we can train the users so that when this happens they realiz that they have made a mistake then we can train users so that they ask before doing something stupid but they will do something stupid".
*   Defense Strategy: Minimize impact, train users to recognize mistakes. "So we need to figure out a way so that when not if but when someone will enable this does not incre us as little as possible then we can train the users so that when this happens they realiz that they have made a mistake then we can train users so that they ask before doing something stupid but they will do something stupid".

### 12. Future Threats üîÆ

*   Cars downloading apps as a future ransomware target. "...at the moment our vehicles cars do not really have common operating systems on their on their control units and head units and do not havead apps but a lot of companies are going to change they are trying to make converge on Android versions of Android and to make vehicles download apps just like the moment this happens with a critical mass we can already for dynamic of the crime is already evidently workable you block a vehicle I need it the alternative is pay a few bucks and back immediately or get it to the dealer and leave it like couple of days there so that they can scratch The mechanism is already evidently going to work".

### 13. Additional Points

*   Slides and announcements are available online.
*   The rise of bots, including IRC bots and DDoS attack tools like trinoo.
*   Discussion of the cybercrime ecosystem, including exploit development, site infection, and monetization on the dark web.
*   Emphasis on understanding and questioning bias in cybersecurity incident reports.
*   The importance of considering internal threats and not just external ones.
